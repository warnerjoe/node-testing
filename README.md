This is a simple Node API server using MVC architecture and Jest for Unit testing.

To use this User auth server:

1) Copy your MONGO_URI into the fake.env file in /src/config/, and then rename it to .env

2) Replace the JWT_SECRET with a secret phrase of your own, make it as secure as humanly possible.
